\title{Event-based calulation of correlation coefficients, lagtimes and signal to noise ratios}
\usage{
cclag_events(event, event_name, mv_win, nmax, plots = T, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{event}{vector of start and end date of event.}

\item{event_name}{character, name of event (mainly used for the plot).}

\item{mv_win}{length of window for moving average to smooth data in order to calculate signal to noise ratios.}

\item{nmax}{number of outputed results per correlation.}

\item{plots}{logical, should the results be plotted? (default is TRUE).}
}
\description{
NEW VERSION of ccf_events !! which uses cclag() instead of timeshift()

So far hard-coded for SM data of wettzell SGnew TS
}
\details{
Output is a data.frame with correlation coeficients, lagtime and signal to soise ratios for each sensor.
